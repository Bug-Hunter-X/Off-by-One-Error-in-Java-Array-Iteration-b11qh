This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The code attempts to sum the elements of an array, but due to an incorrect loop condition, it tries to access an index beyond the array's bounds, leading to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The solution demonstrates the corrected loop condition, providing a robust and error-free approach.
